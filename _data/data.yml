    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Arthur Niedzwiecki found his passion for computer science in his second year at the University of Bremen.
      Soon he was hired as software developer for an app, utilizing mobile devices of construction workers 
      to ease maintainance of their workplace. In the meantime he schooled undergraduate students in Object Oriented Programming
      and common algorithms. Later, still a undergraduate student himself, he worked several years for Encoway, 
      developing front- and backend solutions for complex product configurations, gaining experience in state-of-the-art 
      agile development mechanisms. During a few weeks of vacation the international logistics company K체hne & Nagel 
      hired him for in-depth UI testing of their software.

      At the advent of his Bachelor's degree he jointed the SUTURO Team (sudo-tidy-up-my-room) supported by the 
      Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IAI), where he first got in touch with robots.
      This student's project of 15 people aimed to program an autonomous mobile robot to fulfill complex object manipulation tasks 
      in a pick & place manner. During and after this project he assisted the research staff of the IAI
      by maintaining and developing their cognitive framework. Within this institute he wrote his 
      Bachelor's thesis on transformational planning of robot's activities, optimizing a sequence of tasks by utilizing 
      knowledge about a robot's capabilities over time. Derived from his thesis he published a paper to the IEEE ICRA conference 
      in collaboration with a fellow researcher.

      As a post-graduate student his focus lied prominently on robotics and AI technologies. While still working with the IAI 
      he attended the SUTURO project a second time to broaden his scope to several robots: the PR2 from Willow Garage, Pepper from Aldebaran 
      and a home-made Roomba. His part in the project was to establish the communication between the PR2 and Pepper and maintain fail-safe
      procedures during real-world execution. Simultaneously he started teaching undergraduate students in robot programming with Lisp, 
      incorporating real-world demonstrations of mapping, collision avoidance and path planning on the home-made Roomba.

      Even though not necessary for his studies he worked with the SUTURO Team a third time to attend the RoboCup challenge 2019 
      in Magdeburg for domestic application of autonomous robots, providing a knowledge ontology and general expertise in developing an
      embedded system for the Toyota HSR robot. This challenge was an ideal opportunity to connect with foreign researchers and gain experience
      on contemporary applications. To conclude his post-graduate degree he implemented force feedback reasoning for assembly tasks,
      executed by yet another home-made autonomous mobile robot, equipped with LWR-4+ KUKA lightweight arms. His work combines 
      reactive procedures from the cognitive framework he worked on in the past years, with a physics engine, motion planner and 
      real-world contact forces to increase accuracy for autonomous robots doing intricate tasks in uncertain environments.

      With his experience in different fields of robotics, gained since 2016, Arthur Niedzwiecki is comfortable in a broad spectrum 
      of their application, reaching from high-level control over knowledge representation to low-level sensor evaluation. With his 
      ability to quickly get the grasp on novel problems and being knowledgeable about state-of-the-art AI technology he is an asset for
      a variety of robotic solutions.
