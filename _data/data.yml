    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Arthur Niedzwiecki started his academic career as a mathematic engineer
      in the courses of Technomathematics at the University of bremen. After a 
      short while his passion for programming and information technologies grew, which lead
      him to apply for a change of course, to Computer Science. After only two semesters he was hired
      as an App Developer for a small company already, while simultaneously
      giving classes in practical object-oriented programming at the university.
      
      Later in his Bachelors he was working as Web-Developer at a the 
      custom-solutions company Encoway, gaining him significant insight in modern
      project management and development processes. His vacation time he invested in joining a
      testing team for a logistics application at Kühne & Nagel.
      
      Through several AI projects and intricate courses, leading to the Bachelors Degree and 
      starting the Masters program he began to focus on robotics and intelligent systems, 
      working for the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, where he is developing the 
      cognitive architecture CRAM and giving lectures about robot programming to interested students.
